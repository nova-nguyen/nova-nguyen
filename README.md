Thanks for dropping by. My name is Nova Nguyen, senior student at Denison University majoring in Financial Economics and Data Analytics. I love looking at stock boards and spending my time deciphering what the jumping numbers mean. I've been a hobbyist trader for 3 years trying to turn it into a full time career in investment consulting. Some of my in-class projects include constructing an index portfolio based on the S&P 500 with Gurobi linear optimization. Currently I'm working on detecting cointegration and linkages between emerging markets for international portfolio diversification opportunities, stay tuned for the results to be uploaded on Github! 🤗
